      Appearance:Cheetahs are golden with black spots.They have black lines
      across their face that block the sunlight.Cheetahs have a flexible
      backbone and long legs so they are super fast
    </p>
    <p>Predators: Lions hunt cheetahs. They also steal cheetahs prey</p>
    <p>
      Prey: Cheetahs favorite prey is gazelle.Since gazelle run fast cheetahs
      evolved to be super fast
    </p>
    <p>
      Habitat: Cheetahs live in the savanna which is a perfect place for
      sprinting.It has miles of grass with very few trees
    </p>
    <p>
      Camoflauge: Cheetah cubs have backs that look like badgurs fur because
      lions are scared of badgurs so lions will leave them alone when there
      napping.
